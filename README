Workflow:
Get node properties from Uniprot
Get node values during infection from ViPR
Make initial networks in Python → NetworkX objects
Trim networks with SPRAS
Network measures → Store values on nodes, edges, whole graph
Network perturbations → Store values on nodes and edges

Per job:
One network → SPRAS → Output network

Per job:
One network → One network measure → Dictionary of resulting values
How long does each measure take? Some take a long time, might need another solution for larger networks.

Per job:
One network → Measure complexity → Remove one graph object → Measure complexity → Resulting change (value)
